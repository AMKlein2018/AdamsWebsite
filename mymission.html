				<h2>Past and Present:</h2>
					<p>Since 2012, I have been actively involved in the Autism and Special Needs Community.  My wife and I served on the board of Ascend organization from 2014-2016.  We have a closed <a href=" https://www.facebook.com/groups/PMExceptionalFamiliesandChildren/">EFEC</a> FaceBook group that allows parents and family members communicate and find daily resources.</p>

			<h2>Future Projects:</h2>
				<p>Continue the development of creating My Sensory Locations (currently in the dark).  My Sensory Locations allows individuals to match up individual location environments (i.e. restaurants) to their own sensory needs to determine whether or not that location will suit their individual needs.</p>
